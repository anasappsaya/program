		"summary" : "Nermin Hadži?, managing director of Ankroa Software Inc, software development company located in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I gained my high school education at Druga Gimnazija Sarajevo, and afterwards I obtained a bachelor degree at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at University of Sarajevo. I was a Chair of IEEE Power and Energy Student Society for three years, where I made my first contact with the business world.\nSome of my first successful projects were \"BeEng 2014\", \"study trip to CERN\" and \"RoboStart 2014\"- In these projects more than 150 students took part. My latest project with IEEE Student Branch was BeEng 2016 where over 50 students were involved, and they were given a chance to experience what it is like to be an engineer for a week. In February 2016, I started a web platform http://nabavi.ba , which was my first private project. It was a right move, and platform made a big success on BiH market. At the moment we are working on improvements and new features. In May 2016, I started a Software development company with aim to find partners in entire Europe and become a reliable outsourcing partner. In the previous year we finished more than 20 different projects with partners located in Sweden, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, UK and USA. In January 2017 we teamed up with Povio Labs Y Combinator Winter 2014 Company located in Celje, Slovenia and San Francisco.\nHowever, this gave us an opportunity to grow, and even start some in house projects. Our team contains of 7 highly skilled and educated software engineers/developers and 1 project manager, with aspirations to expand.\nMy biggest challenge at the moment is managing the team which is trying to lunch a new social network called inkaffe (http://inkaffe.com/ ), in cooperation with a team of people located in Serbia, Croatia, Italy and USA.\nSo far, I have gained four years of invaluable professional experience, with three years in management and one year in Power and Software engineering.

I was a Chair of IEEE Power and Energy Student Society for three years, where I made my first contact with the business world.\nSome of my first successful projects were \"BeEng 2014\", \"study trip to CERN\" and \"RoboStart 2014\"- In these projects more than 150 students took part. My latest project with IEEE Student Branch was BeEng 2016 where over 50 students were involved, and they were given a chance to experience what it is like to be an engineer for a week. In February 2016, I started a web platform http://nabavi.ba , which was my first private project. It was a right move, and platform made a big success on BiH market. At the moment we are working on improvements and new features. In May 2016, I started a Software development company with aim to find partners in entire Europe and become a reliable outsourcing partner. In the previous year we finished more than 20 different projects with partners located in Sweden, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, UK and USA. In January 2017 we teamed up with Povio Labs Y Combinator Winter 2014 Company located in Celje, Slovenia and San Francisco.\nHowever, this gave us an opportunity to grow, and even start some in house projects. Our team contains of 7 highly skilled and educated software engineers/developers and 1 project manager, with aspirations to expand.\nMy biggest challenge at the moment is managing the team which is trying to lunch a new social network called inkaffe (http://inkaffe.com/ ), in cooperation with a team of people located in Serbia, Croatia, Italy and USA.\nSo far, I have gained four years of invaluable professional experience, with three years in management and one year in Power and Software engineering.
